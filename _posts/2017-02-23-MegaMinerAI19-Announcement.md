# MegaMinerAI 19 Approaches...

The gears of SIG-Game are turning again, and with them comes the most heated competition this side of Rolla from **April 29th to 30th, noon to noon.**

If you are interested in working to help make MegaMinerAI happen with us, feel free to join us at our general meetings on Thursdays from 3:30pm to 4:30pm in CS217 and we can talk about putting you on one of our many development teams! _All_ majors and skill levels welcome! No experience necessary, we will teach you!
