# MegaMinerAI 19: Stumped - Final Results #

![Stumped](https://github.com/siggame/blog/blob/master/static/img/Stumped_transparency.png)

Last weekend you guys came out to chopped down many trees and built many lodges. And some were victorious! Here are your tournament winners:

## Student Tournament:

This tournament is only eligible students: no alumni, SIG-Game developers, or sponsors. Prizes were awarded at the awards ceremony on Saturday.

### 1st - dumbfreshman

### 2nd - the-newcastle-gnomes

### 3rd - i-am-so-dam-tree-ggered

And `dumbfreshman` were indeed two [smart] freshmen students. Lookout future competitors for these guys!

## Global Tournament:

This tournament includes **everyone**. No awards beyond the prize of being the best at Stumped!

### 1st - the-goldman-clause _[source code](https://github.com/brianwgoldman/megaminerai-19-stumped)_

### 2nd - rmds _Garmin_ _[source code](https://github.com/BobBuehler/megaminerai19)_

### 3rd - dumbfreshman

We'd like to thank everyone involved, from our generous sponsors, and our developers, to our competitors.

If you'd like to see how the entire brackets worked you can find the student results [here][student], and the [global][global] results here. They can be [partially] played back in our [Bracket Visualizer][bracket-vis] (drag and drop the files into the white page).

As always, all our code we used is open source if you want play with it. You can find it all on [GitHub][github].

Thanks, and we hope to see you all next semester for MegaMinerAI 20.
